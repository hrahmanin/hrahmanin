🧠 My interests:
## 🔬 Research Focus

- **Machine Learning for Genomics:** Developed deep learning models (TensorFlow) to predict CTCF occupancy from single-molecule footprinting data (~80% accuracy).
- **3D Genome Organization:** Modeled CTCF-cohesin dynamics and loop extrusion using polymer physics and Hi-C data.
- **Molecular Simulations:** Simulated chromatin folding using OpenMM and Gromacs to quantify effects of dynamic barriers on genome folding.
- **Multi-omics Pipelines:** Built scalable workflows (Nextflow, Singularity) for processing Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq data.
- Chromatin modeling & genome folding
- NGS data analysis (ChIP-seq, Hi-C)
- Machine learning in biology

## 🧰 Key Projects
### 🧠 Predicting 3D Genome Folding from Single-Molecule Footprinting *(GitHub link coming soon)*
Machine learning model to infer 3D chromatin structure using single-molecule data (e.g., methylation footprints). Integrated sequence and occupancy data to predict genome folding and validate with Hi-C.

### 🧬 [dynamic_extrusion_boundaries](https://github.com/Fudenberg-Research-Group/dynamic_extrusion_boundaries)
Mechanistic model of CTCF/cohesin loop extrusion using dynamic barriers. Built in Python + OpenMM. Validated predictions with Hi-C and compartment scores.

### 📊 ChromoScore
Python package to quantify structural features (e.g., TADs, loops) from contact maps. Optimized for simulated Hi-C data. *(Repo: chromoscores)*

### 🧪 fastaFRiP
Reproducible pipeline for ChIP-seq analysis, including FRiP score computation using Bowtie2, samtools, and MACS2. Built for easy adoption and reproducibility.

### 🧷 looplib (Open2C contributor)
Simulates 1D loop extrusion. Contributed to modeling functionality and maintenance of open-source codebase.
